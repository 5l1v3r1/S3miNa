Whats New:
	-- It Now Supports IDM as well as axel (for linux user). Just need to keep in mind that edit core.py and in there find variable named "command" comment / uncomment it to use the program you want / you don't. (I know its a lousy method but i don't want to add arguments for now, because soon i'll be changing the whole script (the downloading site as well :))
